Project Review

Andrew Candelaresi
CSCI 5229 Fall 2017

Completed
I have created a model of the Millenium falcon from scratch, combining simple polygons,  I have also created the cockpit view, I am struggling with how to not draw the ship when in cock pit mode.
For the purpose of the Project Review I have created a  crude sky box scene of the ice planet hoth. I have applied a metal texture to the millenium falcon

TODO:
I need to implement user controled flight in both cockpit view and third person perspective.  I also want to create world for the user to fly through using a DEM Wireframe.  I want to get better textures and more detail added to the millenium falcon as well mapping textures correctly has proven to be extremely challening.  


To compile my project use the command:
make

to clean use the comand:
make clean

To run the project use the command:
./falconscratch
